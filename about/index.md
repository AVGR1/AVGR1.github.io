Headquartered in New Delhi, India, the Airon Ventures focus is to make organizations technology enabled. We started this company in 2016 with our flagship product [MetaTensor](http://metatensor.com/), which helped provide state-of-the-art AI technology to  businesses by connecting worldwide talent. Since then we have started investing and developing AI based technology in emerging markets.

<br/>
Our services now span from consulting to building AI driven technology in Retail, QSR and FMCG segment.

The company was founded by Mr. Ashish Airon, Oxford University alumnus, to provide low cost data driven capabilities to small businesses across India.
